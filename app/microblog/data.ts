    It is high intent like search ads, but also relatively affordable and has a long shelf-life. 
    I don't love writing long articles, but can package original thoughts in small posts like this one.
    I am not sure how many of us in Grand Rapids start our blogs only to abandon them, but I hope my micro-strategy
    will mitigate any burnout!`,

    At least, not for complex tasks like 3D or video rendering or custom machine learning architectures. 
    Sure, it is fantastic for getting a prototype built, but it fails to reach the heights I set for it, regardless of how well I prompt or what else I do.
    Perhaps this will be solved in the next few years, but it has already been a few years since ChatGPT launched, so my optimism has taken a hit.`,

    content: `If you've been watching the quantum developments closely, you might know that we have built machines with hundreds of qubits, some with very low error rates,
    and even some that operate at room-temperature. As the hardware continues to improve, more and more people are using quantum "simulation" to verify algorithms ahead of time.
    Such simulators allow for the testing of thousands or even millions of qubits on traditional hardware. However, the algorithms are struggling across the board, except one crucial
    area - machine learning / artificial intelligence. Building on this, I put forward the idea that we should achieve traditional problem solving via quantum machine learning models.`,
