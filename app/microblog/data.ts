    It is high intent like search ads, but also relatively affordable and has a long shelf-life. 
    I don't love writing long articles, but can package original thoughts in small posts like this one.
    I am not sure how many of us in Grand Rapids start our blogs only to abandon them, but I hope my micro-strategy
    will mitigate any burnout!`,
